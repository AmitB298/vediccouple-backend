# kulerKuler is small and nifty node module that allows you to create terminal basedcolors using hex color codes, just like you're used to doing in your CSS. We'rein a modern world now and terminals support more than 16 colors so we are stupidto not take advantage of this.## InstallationThe package is released in the public npm registry and can be installed byrunning:```npm install --save kuler```## UsageTo color a string simply pass it the string you want to have colored as firstargument and the color as hex as second argument:```js'use strict';const kuler = require('kuler');const str = kuler('foo', '#FF6600');```The color code sequence is automatically terminated at the end of the string sothe colors do no bleed to other pieces of text. So doing:```jsconsole.log(kuler('red', '#F00'), 'normal');```Will work without any issues.## License[MIT](LICENSE)

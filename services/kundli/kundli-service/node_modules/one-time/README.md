# one-timeCall the supplied function exactly one time. This prevents double callbackexecution. This module can be used on both Node.js, React-Native, or browsersusing Browserify. No magical ES5/6 methods used unlike the `once` module does(except for the async version).## InstallationThis module is published to the public npm registry and can be installedby running:```shnpm install --save one-time```## Usage (normal)Simply supply the function with the function that should only be called onetime:```jsvar one = require('one-time');function load(file, fn) {  fn = one(fn);  eventemitter.once('load', fn);  eventemitter.once('error', fn);  // do stuff  eventemitter.emit('error', new Error('Failed to load, but still finished'));  eventemitter.emit('load');}function example(fn) {  fn = one(fn);  fn();  fn('also receives all arguments');  fn('it returns the same value') === 'bar';  fn('never');  fn('gonna');  fn('give');  fn('you');  fn('up');}example(function () {  return 'bar'});```## Usage (async)The same pattern is available for **async** functions as well, for that youshould import that `one-time/async` version instead. This one is optimizedfor **async** and **await** support. It following exactly the same as thenormal version but assumes it's an `async function () {}` that it's wrappinginstead of a regular function, and it will return an `async function() {}`instead of a regular function.```jsimport one from 'one-time/async';const fn = one(async function () {  return await example();});await fn();await fn();await fn();```### Why not `once`?The main reason is that `once` cannot be used in a browser environment unlessit's ES5 compatible. For a module as simple as this I find that unacceptable. Inaddition to that it super heavy on the dependency side. So it's totally notsuitable to be used in client side applications.In addition to that we make sure that your code stays easy to debug as returnedfunctions are named in the same way as your supplied functions. Making heapinspection and stack traces easier to understand.## License[MIT](LICENSE)

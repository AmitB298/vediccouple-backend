text-encoding==============This is a polyfill for the [Encoding LivingStandard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/) API for the Web, allowingencoding and decoding of textual data to and from Typed Array buffersfor binary data in JavaScript.By default it adheres to the spec and does not support *encoding* tolegacy encodings, only *decoding*. It is also implemented to match thespecification's algorithms, rather than for performance. The intendeduse is within Web pages, so it has no dependency on server frameworksor particular module schemes.Basic examples and tests are included.### Install ###There are a few ways you can get and use the `text-encoding` library.### HTML Page Usage ###Clone the repo and include the files directly:```html  <!-- Required for non-UTF encodings -->  <script src="encoding-indexes.js"></script>  <script src="encoding.js"></script>```This is the only use case the developer cares about. If you want thosefancy module and/or package manager things that are popular these daysyou should probably use a different library.#### Package Managers ####The package is published to **npm** and **bower** as `text-encoding`.Use through these is not really supported, since they aren't used bythe developer of the library. Using `require()` in interesting waysprobably breaks. Patches welcome, as long as they don't break thebasic use of the files via `<script>`.### API Overview ###Basic Usage```js  var uint8array = new TextEncoder().encode(string);  var string = new TextDecoder(encoding).decode(uint8array);```Streaming Decode```js  var string = "", decoder = new TextDecoder(encoding), buffer;  while (buffer = next_chunk()) {    string += decoder.decode(buffer, {stream:true});  }  string += decoder.decode(); // finish the stream```### Encodings ###All encodings from the Encoding specification are supported:utf-8 ibm866 iso-8859-2 iso-8859-3 iso-8859-4 iso-8859-5 iso-8859-6iso-8859-7 iso-8859-8 iso-8859-8-i iso-8859-10 iso-8859-13 iso-8859-14iso-8859-15 iso-8859-16 koi8-r koi8-u macintosh windows-874windows-1250 windows-1251 windows-1252 windows-1253 windows-1254windows-1255 windows-1256 windows-1257 windows-1258 x-mac-cyrillicgb18030 hz-gb-2312 big5 euc-jp iso-2022-jp shift_jis euc-krreplacement utf-16be utf-16le x-user-defined(Some encodings may be supported under other names, e.g. ascii,iso-8859-1, etc. See [Encoding](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/) foradditional labels for each encoding.)Encodings other than **utf-8**, **utf-16le** and **utf-16be** requirean additional `encoding-indexes.js` file to be included. It is ratherlarge (596kB uncompressed, 188kB gzipped); portions may be deleted ifsupport for some encodings is not required.### Non-Standard Behavior ###As required by the specification, only encoding to **utf-8** issupported. If you want to try it out, you can force a non-standardbehavior by passing the `NONSTANDARD_allowLegacyEncoding` option toTextEncoder and a label. For example:```jsvar uint8array = new TextEncoder(  'windows-1252', { NONSTANDARD_allowLegacyEncoding: true }).encode(text);```But note that the above won't work if you're using the polyfill in abrowser that natively supports the TextEncoder API natively, since thepolyfill won't be used!You can force the polyfill to be used by using this before the polyfill:```html<script>window.TextEncoder = window.TextDecoder = null;</script>```To support the legacy encodings (which may be stateful), theTextEncoder `encode()` method accepts an optional dictionary and`stream` option, e.g. `encoder.encode(string, {stream: true});` Thisis not needed for standard encoding since the input is always incomplete code points.
